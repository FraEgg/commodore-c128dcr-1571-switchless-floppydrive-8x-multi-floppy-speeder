# Switchless Floppy Drive 8x Multi Floppy Speeder for the Commodore 1541 floppy disk drive (V2.2c)



## ATF16V8 PLD

ATF16V8 is a high-performance CMOS Electrically-Erasable Programmable Logic Device. This component controls the address logic of the EPROM and RAM for the C128DCR 8x Multi-Speeder. I use ATF16V8B(QL) types in DIP (THT) form factors.

The firmware file `.jed` can be downloaded.
