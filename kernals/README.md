### C128/C64 and 1571 Test-Kernels

Here I have prepared two EPROMs for the Multi-Speeder and the C128/C64 U32 Kernal-Switcher. This contains the DolphinDos 3 and the original CBM-DOS. JiffyDOS can be added by each owner himself. Since JiffyDOS is still being marketed, I do not include it in the ROMs for copyright reasons.

# ROM Organization

The firmware (kernels) for the 1571 floppy drive and C128/C64 are stored in a 512 KB EPROM of type 27C040 or 29F040 (PLCC32) and organized into 8x 64 KB banks. Each bank (0â€“7) represents the complete 64 KB address range.



## Internal 1571 Floppy Drive

The address decoder of the Multi-Speeder Board maps the ROM in the floppy drive to the address range `$8000 to $FFFF`.

**Please note:** When operating the Multi-Speeder Board, the original DOS-ROM U102 must be removed entirely, as the Multi-Speeder now provides the selected DOS kernel via its own EPROM! Leaving the original ROM in place would create an address conflict, causing the floppy drive to malfunction.



Here is the configuration of the example kernals:

| Bank | Switch  | System            | U32 C128 | U32 C64      | U101 1571    | EPROM           |
| ---- | ------- | ----------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------ | --------------- |
| 0    | 1@RNROM | CBM               | CBM      | CBM          | CBM          | `$08000-$0FFFF` |
| 1    | 2@RNROM | CBM RAM Exp       | CBM      | CBM          | CBM RAM Exp. | `$18000-$1FFFF` |
| 2    | 3@RNROM | DolphinDos 3      | DD3      | DD3          | DD3          | `$28000-$2FFFF` |
| 3    | 4@RNROM | DolphinDos 3      | DD3      | DD3-Custom   | DD3          | `$38000-$3FFFF` |
| 4    | 5@RNROM | CBM-DD-SD2IEC     | CBM      | DD-JD-SD2IEC | CBM RAM Exp. | `$48000-$4FFFF` |
| 5    | 6@RNROM | CBM               | CBM      | JaffyDos 1.3 | CBM RAM Exp. | `$58000-$5FFFF` |
| 6    | 7@RNROM | CBM (reserved JD) | CBM      | CBM          | CBM RAM Exp. | `$68000-$6FFFF` |
| 7    | 8@RNROM | CBM (reserved JD) | CBM      | CBM          | CBM RAM Exp. | `$78000-$7FFFF` |



## C128/C64 Kernels

The kernel ROM 27256 (U32) in the C128DCR is structured as follows:

| ROM Address Range | ROM Type                     | CPU Address Range |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `$0000 - $1FFF`   | C64 Basic V2 `$A000 - $BFFF` | 8 KB              |
| `$2000 - $3FFF`   | C64 Kernel `$E000 - $FFFF`   | 8 KB              |
| `$4000 - $7FFF`   | C128 Kernel/System           | 16 KB             |

The C128/C64 Kernel Switcher Board for the U32 socket is organized as follows. It is important to note that, for the 512 KB EPROM (27C040 and 29F040), only the upper 32 KB of the 64 KB banks (`$x8000 - $xFFFF`) are currently used. Therefore, the kernels must be placed starting at `$x8000`.
